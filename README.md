## Installation

### HACS Installation

1. Go to the HACS settings and add this repository as a custom repository.
2. Search for "Lunar Phase" in HACS and install it.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=ngocjohn&repository=lunar-phase&category=Integration)

### Manual Installation

1. Download the `lunar_phase` folder from this repository.
2. Copy the `lunar_phase` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory. The `custom_components` directory resides in the same directory as your `configuration.yaml` file.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

### Using the Home Assistant UI

To configure the Lunar Phase integration, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Home Assistant dashboard.
2. Navigate to `Configuration` > `Devices & Services` > `Add Integration`.
3. Search for `Lunar Phase` and select it.
4. You will be prompted to enter the city for your location.
   - **City**: Enter the name of your city. If the city is not found in the database, you will be prompted to provide additional information:
     - **Region**: The region or state where the city is located.
     - **Timezone**: The timezone of the city.
     - **Latitude**: The latitude coordinate of the city.
     - **Longitude**: The longitude coordinate of the city.

Once configured, the integration will add the Moon Phase sensor along with other diagnostic sensors that provide detailed lunar information.
